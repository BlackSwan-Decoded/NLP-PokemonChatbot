#### This is a chatbot that can talk to you about pokemon. It was created for an assignment for my NLP course.

##### The chatbot can be used in the following ways:
- [ ] Greet the chatbot: Saying, Hi, Hello, good morning, goodnight, good afternoon, how are you, or how are you doing, etc will trigger an appropriate response.
